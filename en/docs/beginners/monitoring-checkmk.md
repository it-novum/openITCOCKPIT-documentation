# Monitoring with Checkmk <span class="badge badge-primary badge-outlined" title="Community Edition">CE</span>

Checkmk is seamlessly integrated into the openITCOCKPIT interface. Hosts running the Checkmk agent or an SNMP exporter
can thus be scanned using the openITCOCKPIT interface. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will be monitoring an
Ubuntu Linux system.

### Installing the Checkmk module for openITCOCKPIT

The Checkmk extension for openITCOCKPIT is provided as a module. Making such tools available in this way has the
advantage of keeping the openITCOCKPIT core small and flexible.

!!! info "openITCOCKPIT Community Licence is required"
    To get access to the community modules, you need to register your openITCOCKPIT instance using the **free** community
    licence.

Navigate to `Management -> System Tools -> Package Manager` and install the *CheckmkModule*

![packagemanager install checkmk](/images/package-manager-install-checkmk.png)

Follow the instructions provided

![packagemanager install instructions](/images/package-manger-install-instructions.png)

The installation will be complete when you see the following
message: `Installation done. Please reload your openITCOCKPIT web interface.`

Navigate back in your web browser and press `Strg + R` or `Cmd + R` to refresh the page.

The CheckmkModule should now be displayed as installed.

![installed successful](/images/checkmk-integration-installed-successfully.png)

Each module provides the ability to extend openITCOCKPIT's available permissions. By default, all permissions are
granted to the `Administrator` user role.

If your current user is mapped to another user role, make sure you grant that role the appropriate permissions.

Navigate to `Administration -> User Management -> Manage User Roles` and select your user role.

![checkmk userrole permissions grant](/images/checkmk-user-roles-permissions.png)

New permissions are not automatically granted (except for users who hold the Administrator user role). This is because
not every user is allowed to use modules that, for example, were only installed for test or evaluation purposes.

### Installing Checkmk Agent on the target system

As already mentioned, we use the Checkmk agent for monitoring remote systems.

To begin using this tool, you must first copy the Checkmk agent from your openITCOCKPIT server to the target system:

`scp /opt/openitc/check_mk/agents/check_mk_agent.linux root@172.16.166.103:/usr/local/bin/check_mk_agent`

!!! tip
    "All Checkmk agents for the various operating systems can be found here"
    `/opt/openitc/check_mk/agents/`

**Now connect to the remote host via SSH**

The Checkmk agent is not run as a daemon but rather by `xinetd`.

```
apt-get install xinetd
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/check_mk_agent
```

!!! danger "Security Notice"
   By default, Checkmk uses unencrypted plain text communication!

Next you need to copy the following configuration to `/etc/xinetd.d/check_mk`:

```
service check_mk
{
    type           = UNLISTED
    port           = 6556
    socket_type    = stream
    protocol       = tcp
    wait           = no
    user           = root
    server         = /usr/local/bin/check_mk_agent

    # configure the IP address(es) of your openITCOCKPIT server here:
    #only_from      = 127.0.0.1 10.0.20.1 10.0.20.2

    # Don't be too verbose. Don't log every check. This might be
    # commented out for debugging. If this option is commented out
    # the default options will be used for this service.
    log_on_success =

    disable        = no
}
```

To enable the new configuration, you must restart `xinetd`:

```
systemctl restart xinetd.service
```

That's everything that needs to be done on the remote host.

### Scanning target host to create checks automatically

In the host systems’ context menu, select the `Checkmk detection` option.

![checkmk discovery](/images/checkmk-discovery.png)

Now select "Use the Checkmk agent for detection". Select `Checkmk Agent` as the data source.

![checkmk remote discovery](/images/checkmk-remote-discovery-4-3.png)

Once the discovery process has completed, you can select any services you wish to monitor. Click `Save` to continue.

![select checkmk services](/images/select-check-mk-services-4-3.png)

To enable the new configuration, you
must [update the monitoring configuration](../create-first-host/#updating-the-monitoring-configuration).

Once this has been done, the system will begin monitoring the selected services a few seconds later. It will also
generate graphs whenever this is possible.

![checkmk services openitcockpit](/images/checkmk-services-openitcockpit.png)

## Monitoring via SNMP with Checkmk

Many devices such as routers, switches, sensors or operating systems can be monitored via SNMP (Simple Network
Management Protocol). Before continuing with this guide, make sure you have read the section
entitled [Monitoring with Checkmk](#monitoring-with-checkmk-ce).

### Get SNMP data for the target device

Before you get started, please check whether your monitoring server is able to query SNMP data from the target device.
The program `snmpwalk` can be used for this.

In this example we will query an Ubuntu Linux machine running `snmpd` version `2c` and the community `public`.

```
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 172.16.166.103
```

You should then see output similar to this:

![snmp walk example](/images/snmpwalk_example.png)

If your system is not able to connect to the target system, check your firewall settings to see whether you are using
the wrong SNMP version.

### Monitoring a Linux host using SNMP via Checkmk

Select the `Checkmk detection` option in the context menu for the host system.

![checkmk discovery snmp](/images/checkmk-discovery-snmp.png)

Select the `Enable SNMP` option. The system will ask you for the required SNMP parameters. The SNMP configuration is
saved on a per host basis, so you won't have to enter this data again. Then click Run detection to continue.

![checkmk remote discovery](/images/checkmk-remote-discovery-4-3.png)

Once the discovery process has completed, you can select any services you would like to monitor. Click `Next` to
continue.

![checkmk snmp result](/images/checkmk-snmp-result.png)

To enable the new configuration, you
must [update the monitoring configuration](../create-first-host/#updating-the-monitoring-configuration).

Once this has been done, the monitoring system will begin monitoring the selected services a few seconds later. It will
also generate graphs whenever this is possible.

![checkmk snmp services](/images/checkmk-snmp-services.png)

### Using description for SNMP interfaces

Depending on the device being monitored, it is advisable to use the SNMP _description_ or alias instead of the index as
the identifier for network interfaces.

By default, the index is used for monitoring interfaces. This can be easily recognised by the interface name.

![Checkmk network interfaces monitored by index](/images/checkmk-snmp-interface-index.png)

If you would prefer to use the interface description instead of the index, a new Checkmk rule must be created.

To do this, create the file
`/opt/openitc/check_mk/etc/check_mk/conf.d/wato/interface_description_rule.mk`
with the following content:

```
globals().setdefault('inventory_if_rules', [])

inventory_if_rules = [
{'id': '35a60268-6aa0-4fb8-8fed-ba51e6b1d1e3', 'value': {'discovery_single': (True, {'item_appearance': 'descr', 'pad_portnumbers': True}), 'matching_conditions': (True, {})}, 'condition': {}},
] + inventory_if_rules
```

Any new interface checks you create will now use the description.

![Checkmk network interfaces monitored by description](/images/checkmk-snmp-interface-description.png)

If you choose to use the alias instead of the (_description_) , you must use the following: `'item_appearance': 'alias'`
.

## Create missing service templates for Checkmk.

Depending on the device on which you want to perform a discovery, you may find that the Options selection box is empty
and the following
text `Before you can monitor the following services, a corresponding service template must be created.` appears,
followed by a table. If this is the case, you will have to create the missing service templates.

![check mk snmp missing servicetemplates](/images/check-mk-snmp-missing-service-template.png)

### Creating missing service templates

Open a new browser window and navigate to `Monitoring -> Templates -> Service Templates` and click `+ New`.

#### Create a service template for `hp_procurve_cpu`

It is recommended you use the same name for a service template as Checkmk uses (MK Check). In this case, the MK Check
is `hp_procurve_cpu` so we use `CHECK_MK_HP_PROCURVE_CPU` as the service template name. Set `Checkmk templates` as the
template type. Disable `Enable active checks`, use `check_none` as the check command and set the Parameter from the
table as `ARG1`.

Confirm with `Create service templates`

![create missing checkmk snmp servicetemplate](/images/create_missing_check_mk_snmp_service_template.png)

Servicevorlagen Parameter Übersicht:

| Parameter      | Value                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Template name |    CHECK_MK_HP_PROCURVE_CPU  |
| Service name | CPU load on HP Procurve |
| Template type | Checkmk templates |
| Enable active checks | No |
| Check command | check_none |
| ARG1 | `(80.0, 90.0)` |
| Check period | 24x7 |
| Max. number of check attempts | 1 |
| Check interval | 60 |
| Retry interval | 60 |

Repeat these steps for any service templates that may be missing.

#### Link service templates to MK Checks

Go to `Check MK -> Mk Checks` and click the `+ New` button.

Set `hp_procurve_cpu` as Check name and select the corresponding service template `CHECK_MK_HP_PROCURVE_CPU`.

![link servicetemplate to mk check](/images/link_check_mk_check_to_service_template.png)

Now repeat this for all service templates.

![check_mk_mkchecks_to_servicetemplates](/images/check_mk_mkchecks_to_servicetemplates.jpg)

### Creating services

You are now able to create the services you want to monitor. Restart SNMP Discovery and select all desired services from
the list that appears.

![checkmk create new snmp services](/images/checkmk-create-new-snmp-services.png)

To enable the new configuration, you
must [update the monitoring configuration](../create-first-host/#updating-the-monitoring-configuration).

![checkmk snmp hp switch](/images/checkmk-snmp-hp-switch.png)

### Mixing surveillance methods

You can use both SNMP and the Checkmk agent at the same time without issue. To do this, select `Enable Checkmk agent`,
select `Checkmk Agent` as the data soucre and Enable `Enable SNMP` as well as the SNMP version and your desired
community.

![checkmk remote discovery](/images/checkmk-remote-discovery-4-3.png)

## Define custom rules

Checkmk is a rule-based monitoring tool. Therefore, if needed, some standards can be adjusted through user-defined rules.

To ensure that custom rules are always loaded last and not overwritten by openITCOCKPIT, user-defined rules must be placed in the file
`/opt/openitc/check_mk/etc/check_mk/conf.d/wato/zz_rules.mk`. If the file does not exist, you can simply create it.


### Interface description

When monitoring network interfaces, it is often useful to use the description or alias instead of the index for monitoring.

Copy the following rule into the file `zz_rules.mk`. Valid values for the `item_appearance` field are: `alias`, `descr`, or `index`.
```
inventory_if_rules = [
{'id': 'cf1d4626-052a-4b7d-9f17-8e42bab49222', 'value': {'discovery_single': (True, {'item_appearance': 'alias', 'pad_portnumbers': True}), 'matching_conditions': (True, {})}, 'condition': {}, 'options': {'disabled': False, 'comment': 'Use alias for Interfaces'}},
] + inventory_if_rules
```

### Interface Traffic in Bit/s

The unit of current traffic on a network interface can be changed from Byte/s `(5 Mb/s)` to Bit/s `(40 Mbit/s)` if needed.

Kopieren Sie dafür die folgende Regel in die Datei `zz_rules.mk`.
Copy the following rule into the file `zz_rules.mk`.

```
checkgroup_parameters['if'] = [
{'id': 'a25bc8b5-b827-4215-8df5-1b9abad01f5b', 'value': {'unit': 'bit'}, 'condition': {}, 'options': {'disabled': False, 'comment': 'SNMP Interface speed in bits'}},
] + checkgroup_parameters['if']
```

![Checkmk custom rules](/images/checkmk_custom_rules.png)


## Creating the Checkmk agent

To create a Checkmk agent, go to `Monitoring -> Checkmk -> Checkmk Agents` in the main menu.

Then click on the "New" button in the overview section.

Now select a container, give it a name and then enter the appropriate command line command. The command you use will
refer to a Checkmk script on the openITCOCKPIT server.

| Field        | Required                  | Description                                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Container    | :fontawesome-solid-xmark: | The container in which the Checkmk Agent is to be installed |
| Name         | :fontawesome-solid-xmark: | Name of the Checkmk agent                                   |
| Description  |                           | Description of the Checkmk agent                            |
| Command line | :fontawesome-solid-xmark: | Command line command for the Checkmk agent script           |

### Downloading Checkmk agents

You can easily download Checkmk agents via openITCOCKPIT by going to `Monitoring -> Checkmk -> Checkmk Agents` and then
to the `Agent downloads` tab.
