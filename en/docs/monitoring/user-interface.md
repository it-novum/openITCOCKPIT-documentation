# User Interface

### The interface at a glance

The the user interface is divided into two areas: The navigation area (1. Blue) and the content area (2. Red). The
navigation area of openITCOCKPIT always remains the same while the content of the selected page is always displayed in
the content area (2).

![user-interface](/images/user-interface.png)

### The navigation area in detail

#### The top navigation bar

![top nav bar](/images/layout-header-explaination.png)

In addition to a search function (2) and the time of day (7), the upper navigation bar contains further short links to
various actions

1. Button to pop out/close the main menu
2. Search bar with the option to search for hosts, services, UUIDs and IP addresses
3. Subscription badge - only visible for unregistered and community editions
4. [System Health](#system-health)
5. [Export](../basic-principles/#export) button
6. Indicates whether a new openITCOCKPIT version is available. Only visible when a new version is available.
7. Displays the [Message of the day](#message-of-the-day)
8. Current [(server)time](#system-times)
9. Language selection box
10. Log-out

##### System health

The system health display provides a quick overview of the status of the openITCOCKPIT server. Warnings and critical
states, such as insufficient hard disk space, critical memory utilisation and services that are not running, are
displayed here. If the display is empty and green, everything is in order and the server is running as expected (see
screenshot).

![system health](/images/system-health.png)

##### Message of the day

In order to inform all users or selected user groups about a certain event at the same time, openITCOCKPIT offers the
ability to create a `Message of the Day`. This message is always displayed automatically after logging in.

![message of the day](/images/message-otd-modal.png)

In addition, the `Message of the Day` can be displayed by clicking on the menu item (7).

![message of the day](/images/message-of-the-day.png)

The [configuration](../../configuration/usermanagement/#creating-the-message-of-the-day) for the `Message of the Day` can be
found as a separate item under User Administration

##### System times

The user interface is able to display two different times.

![user server time](/images/user-servertime.png)

This happens automatically as soon as the local user time (1) differs from the server time (2). Adjustments to the user
time zone can be made in the user's [profile](#profile-information).

#### Main menu

![main menu](/images/main-menu.png)

In addition to listing all menu items, the main menu in openITCOCKPIT also offers the ability to search through the
menu (1). To do this, just click once on the :fontawesome-solid-angle-down: button. This makes it much easier to find
individual menu items.

Below this you will also see your username displayed. The golden crown indicates that administrator rights are available
for this user. Clicking on the username will take you to the user profile.

Below the main menu you will find some additional buttons (3):

- :fontawesome-solid-chart-line: links to an overview that allows you to send anonymised statistics to the openITCOCKPIT
  developer team.
- :fontawesome-solid-bug: leads to the support overview page. There you have the ability to report bugs as well as get
  commercial support.
- :fontawesome-solid-life-ring: links to an overview of the available subscriptions for obtaining commercial support and
  enterprise modules.
- :fontawesome-solid-book: links to an overview page that contains further links to various documentation.

#### Page menu button

The page menu button can always be seen at the bottom right of the screen and contains two functions that can be used on
any page in openITCOCKPIT.

- :fontawesome-solid-expand: displays the page in full-screen mode.
- :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up: scrolls automatically to the top of the current page.

### Profile

In the profile overview, you have the ability to make adjustments to your own user profile.

#### Profile information

change the list displays, browser displays and more.

![Profil Information edit](/images/profile-information.png)

2. The recursive browser takes into account the nested elements in the [browser](#browser) below the currently selected
   container.
3. The length of lists affects the list items displayed on a page. This setting has a global effect on all lists.
4. The display language for the user can also be changed here.
5. The user's desired date format.
6. The user's time zone.

#### Profile picture

To upload a profile picture, you can simply drag and drop the desired picture into the field provided. Uploading and
saving is then carried out automatically.

#### Changing passwords

!!! info
    This option is only available for local users. Users added via LDAP must change their password via the
    operating system or an LDAP account manager tool.

To change your password, you can use this form. To do this, you must have your old password ready and be ready to assign
a new password. The requirements for the new password are at least 6 alphanumeric characters and at least one digit.

![Profile change password](/images/profile-changepassword.png)

#### API keys

You can create API keys – which are used for authenticating with the openITCOCKPIT API – via your profile. You can find
out how to create an API key in a [separate article](../../development/api/#api-keys)

## Browser

The browser provides a user-visible overview of all containers, their hosts and the status of the hosts and services.

The host and service status display shows by default only the status of the hosts and services that are in the currently
selected container.

Using the `recursive browser` setting in your profile settings, the overall status of all hosts and services visible to
a user can be displayed.

## Host browser

The host browser provides an overview of the current status of the host and its services. It also provides detailed
status and device information, a timeline and, if modules are installed, even more additional information about the
host.

template group as well as the services to be created. This makes it possible to very quickly create the appropriate
services for a host. The configuration must then be exported for the changes to take effect.

status type. You also have the option of performing various actions here.
