# Service Capacity Management Module (Resource Management Module) <span class="badge badge-danger badge-outlined" title="Enterprise Edition">EE</span>

The Service Capacity Management can be installed via the package manager of openITCOCKPIT.
Navigate to `Administration -> System Tools -> Package Manager` and install the *ScmModule*

With Service Capacity Management Module, providers have the opportunity to communicate the status of their resources (
e.g., IT services) at a specified time to better channel potential bottlenecks.

## Global Settings

In this area, it is determined by when (deadline) the status of a resource must be communicated at the latest. A cron
job checks whether a status has been communicated for each resource. The reminder time (in minutes) specifies the period
within which a reminder email is sent to providers with missing status. Additionally, it can be specified whether an
already set status can be overwritten (<b>"Allow status overwriting"</b>). Another restriction of status communication
can be set via the "<b>Require user assignment</b>" setting. If this checkbox is active, only the assigned users are
allowed to set a status.

## Resource Groups

Under the menu item `Administration -> Resource Center -> Resource Groups`, you can access the configuration area of the
resource groups.

![Menu Resource Groups](/images/scm/scm_resourcegroups_menu.png)

Here, new resource groups can be created, or already created resource groups are listed.

### Create a New Resource Group

By clicking the <code>+ New</code> button, the area where you can create a new resource group opens.

The container determines the visibility of this group. Automatically, this serves as a filter for user selection. The
user selection determines which users are allowed to set a status. The division between managers and users determines
who receives a reminder email in case of missing status. An escalation is triggered if no status is set even after the
reminder email is sent. The escalation goes to all users and managers.

## Resource

Via the menu item `Administration -> Resource Center -> Resource`, you can access the overview page of the individual
resources. By clicking the <code>My resources</code> button, the list is filtered by your own resources. The list
provides all details about the individual resources and their status information.

All resources are sorted by status.

![Resources Overview](/images/scm/scm_resources_list.png)

Unconfirmed resources are displayed first.
A resource can have one of the following statuses:

| Status | Info            |
|--------|-----------------|
| ðŸŸ¦     | unconfirmed (0) |
| ðŸŸ©     | ok (1)          |
| ðŸŸ§     | warning (2)     |
| ðŸŸ¥     | critical (3)    |

Via the menu item `Set status for selected`, the status for multiple resources can be set. Alternatively, the status for
a single resource can also be set.

![Set Status](/images/scm/scm_set_status.png)

Every submitted status is logged and can be viewed via the "Status log" menu item.

![Resources Status Log](/images/scm/scm_statuslog.png)

As with the resource group, clicking the <code>+ New</code> button creates a new resource. In the selection, you choose
the associated resource group. The name of the resource is defined as a mandatory field. The description is optional.

![Add Resource](/images/scm/scm_resource_add.png)

| Field          | Required                  | Description                 |
|----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|

| Name           | :fontawesome-solid-xmark: | Name of the resource        |
| Description    |                           | Description of the resource |

All changes to the resource and resource groups are logged and can be viewed via the `Changelog` menu item.

## Dashboards

A custom widget for the dashboard allows users to always see the current status of their assigned resources.

![Add My Resources Widget](/images/scm/scm_add_my_resources_widget.png)

Depending on the status, an appropriate message is always displayed. As in this example:

![My Resources Widget](/images/scm/scm_my_resources_widget.png)

If the deadline is exceeded, but not all resources have a status communicated, a notice is displayed.
