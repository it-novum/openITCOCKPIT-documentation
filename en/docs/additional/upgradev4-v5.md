### Preparing the system

#### Step 1 - Enable non-free repositories

By default, the `non-free` repositories are enabled an all installations of openITCOCKPIT.
It's recommended check if your system is configured to access `contrib` and `non-free` packages.

##### Ubuntu users

Make sure the universe repositories have been activated on your system.

```bash
add-apt-repository universe
```

##### Debian users

Make sure that the non-free repositories have been activated on your system.
Ensure you have enabled `contrib` and `non-free` repositories in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources`

```bash
Types: deb deb-src
URIs: mirror+file:///etc/apt/mirrors/debian.list
Suites: bookworm bookworm-updates bookworm-backports
Components: main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

Types: deb deb-src
URIs: mirror+file:///etc/apt/mirrors/debian-security.list
Suites: bookworm-security
Components: main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
```

#### Step 2 - Update the operating system

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade
```

#### Step 3 - Back up the database

!!! warning
    Make sure that there is sufficient free hard disk space before you attempt to create a backup!

#### Step 4 - Carry out the openITCOCKPIT 5 compatibility check

To ensure that your system is capable of being updated to openITCOCKPIT 5.x, we provide a compatibility script for checking your system(s).

Execute the following script on your openITCOCKPIT instance:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/it-novum/openITCOCKPIT/development/bin/scripts/oitc4to5.sh | sudo /bin/bash
```

![oitc4to5 successful compatibility check](/images/openitcockpit5/oitc4to5_success.png)


**No changes have been made to your system at this point!**

!!! danger
    Do not continue with the update if you receive any errors or warnings after carrying out the compatibility check!


First resolve the issues that have been highlighted and run the script again. Once you have resolved all errors, you can continue with the update.


### Breaking Changes

While we tried to keep the openITCOCKPIT 5 as compatible as possible, a large update like this comes with some breaking changes.

!!! danger
    **During the update, all stored filters will be deleted.**
    
    We recommend to export the MySQL table `openitcockpit.filter_bookmarks` before the update, so you can use the information to recreate the filters after the update.


![Truncate of current stored filters](/images/openitcockpit5/filter_bookmarks.png)


### Upgrade openITCOCKPIT

Your system is now prepared and ready to upgrade to openITCOCKPIT 5.

#### Step 1 – Sign out from openITCOCKPIT

openITCOCKPIT 5 ships with an entirely new frontend. For a soothe upgrade experience, it is recommended to sign out from from openITCOCKPIT first.

You can find the `sign out` button in the top right corner.

![Sign out from openITCOCKPIT](/images/openitcockpit5/upgrade_4_to_5_sign_out.png)

#### Step 2 - Change Repository

openITCOCKPIT 5 uses a different repository address than openITCOCKPIT 4 does. 
This is to prevent unexpected system upgrades.

The new address ist: `packages5.openitcockpit.io`.

##### Ubuntu users

```bash
curl https://packages5.openitcockpit.io/repokey.txt | tee /etc/apt/keyrings/openitcockpit-keyring.asc
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/openitcockpit-keyring.asc] https://packages5.openitcockpit.io/openitcockpit/$(lsb_release -sc)/stable $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openitcockpit.list

apt-get update
```

##### Debian users

```bash
curl https://packages5.openitcockpit.io/repokey.txt | tee /etc/apt/keyrings/openitcockpit-keyring.asc
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/openitcockpit-keyring.asc] https://packages5.openitcockpit.io/openitcockpit/$(lsb_release -sc)/stable $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openitcockpit.list

apt-get update
```

##### RHEL8 users

!!! warning
    Make sure to add your openITCOCKPIT license key to the end of the repository configuration file:
    ```
    username=secret
    password=e5aef99e-817b-0ff5-3f0e-140c1f342792
    ```

```bash
cat <<EOT > /etc/yum.repos.d/openitcockpit.repo
[openitcockpit]
name=openITCOCKPIT Monitoring System
baseurl=https://packages5.openitcockpit.io/openitcockpit/RHEL8/stable/\$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages5.openitcockpit.io/repokey.txt
EOT

dnf --refresh check-update
```

##### RHEL9 users

!!! warning
    Make sure to add your openITCOCKPIT license key to the end of the repository configuration file:
    ```
    username=secret
    password=e5aef99e-817b-0ff5-3f0e-140c1f342792
    ```

```bash
cat <<EOT > /etc/yum.repos.d/openitcockpit.repo
[openitcockpit]
name=openITCOCKPIT Monitoring System
baseurl=https://packages5.openitcockpit.io/openitcockpit/RHEL8/stable/\$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages5.openitcockpit.io/repokey.txt
EOT

dnf --refresh check-update
```

#### Step 3 - Migrate license

Users of the openITCOCKPIT Community Edition and Enterprise Edition can continue to use their existing license key. It is important to change the repository address to `packages5.openitcockpit.io` in the file `/etc/apt/auth.conf.d/openitcockpit.conf` before you continue with the update.

The file should look like this:
```
machine packages5.openitcockpit.io login secret password e5aef99e-817b-0ff5-3f0e-140c1f342792
```

To apply the changes, run the following command:

```bash
apt-get update
```


#### Step 4 -  Updating openITCOCKPIT

!!! warning
    Stable SSH connection is required! The update process may take a while. To prevent SSH connection problems, we recommend using `tmux` or `screen`.

During the update you may be asked if you want to overwrite some configuration files with newer versions. These configuration files belong to the operating system, so you can choose whether you want to keep your current versions or update to the newer versions. This will have no impact on the openITCOCKPIT update.

To start the update, execute:

```bash
apt-get dist-upgrade
```

#### Step 5 - Clear browser cache

Before logging into your new openITCOCKPIT interface, you should clear your browser cache

Mozilla Firefox: <https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache>

Google Chrome: <https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en>

#### Step 6 - Reboot the system

A system restart is recommended, but not required.

The update to openITCOCKPIT 5 is now completed 🎉.

### Updating the openITCOCKPIT satellite systems (only applies to distributed monitoring)

The Update process for openITCOCKPIT Satellite Systems is straight forward.
openITCOCKPIT 5 can also communicate with openITCOCKPIT 4 satellites.
While an upgrade is **recommended**, it is not required (at least for now)

#### Step 1 - Update the operating system

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade
```

#### Step 2 - Change Repository

openITCOCKPIT 5 uses a different repository address than openITCOCKPIT 4 does. 
This is to prevent unexpected system upgrades.

The new address ist: `packages5.openitcockpit.io`.

#### Step 3 - Carry out the openITCOCKPIT Satellite 5 compatibility check

To ensure that your system is capable of being updated to openITCOCKPIT 5.x, we provide a compatibility script for checking your system(s).

Execute the following script on your openITCOCKPIT Satellite instance:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/it-novum/openITCOCKPIT/refs/heads/development/bin/scripts/oitcSat4to5.sh | sudo /bin/bash
```

#### Step 4 -  Updating openITCOCKPIT Satellite

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade
```



### Known problems

#### PHP 8.0 on RHEL
openITCOCKPIT **requires** PHP in version 8.1 or newer. 
Some Enterprise Linux installations still use PHP 8.0, in this case you need to upgrade your PHP version first.

Due to the amount of support complexity with Enterprise Linux systems, only the [openITCOCKPIT Enterprise Edition](https://openitcockpit.io/editions/) is avaiable for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux and RHEL based distributions such as: CentOS, Rocky Linux AlmaLinux or Oracle Linux.

Please get in [touch with us](https://it-services.it-novum.com/en/) if you need assistants upgrading your installation of openITCOCKPIT.


Before you start, make sure you have installed the latest updates for your system:
```bash
dnf --refresh check-update

dnf update
```

This document assumes that you have installed PHP from [Remi's RPM repository](https://rpms.remirepo.net/).

To upgrade your PHP version, please run the following command:

```
dnf module switch-to php:remi-8.1
```

This will switch your system to the latest version of PHP 8.1. You can also go with PHP 8.2 or 8.3.

To finish the upgrade, please run the following command:

```bash
openitcockpit-update
```

#### Grafana

The Grafana version shipped with openITCOCKPIT 5 will now use MySQL as database backend. This improves the API performance of Grafana by a lot.
This change only affects traditional installations of openITCOCKPIT. Docker installations of openITCOCKPIT will continue to use SQLite as database backend for Grafana.
How ever, it is possible to switch the database backend of Grafana in Docker installations as well if preferred.

This change requires to re-syncronize **Grafana User Dashboards**. You can do this by selecting all Grafana Dashboards and clicking on the `Synchronize` button at the bottom of the page.

![Synchronize Grafana User Dashboards](/images/openitcockpit5/sync_userdefined_grafana_dashboards.png)

openITCOCKPIT will re-create all automatically generated Grafana dashboards automatically.
It is also possible to force the re-creation of all Grafana dashboards by running the following command:

```bash
openitcockpit-update --cc
oitc cronjobs -f
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Network error

If you find you are having connectivity errors with your system, you can try to repair the installation. To do this, use the following command:

```bash
apt-get install -f
```

#### No Graphs / CPU does not support x86-64-v2

If you do not get any graphs after upgrading to openITCOCKPIT 5, Grafana does not work, or you receive the error message `Fatal glibc error: CPU does not support x86-64-v2`,
you are either using a very old CPU that is no longer supported by openITCOCKPIT 5,
or you are running openITCOCKPIT in a virtual machine and have not set a CPU type.

If the `openitcockpit-graphing.service` cannot start, you should check the CPU type first.

You can check if you are affected by the `Fatal glibc error: CPU does not support x86-64-v2` error by trying to start the MySQL server as a Docker container.

##### CPU Error

In case of an error, you will receive the following output and the MySQL server will automatically terminate:

```bash
docker run --rm -it mysql:latest

Fatal glibc error: CPU does not support x86-64-v2
```

To fix this, you need to adjust the CPU type of your virtual machine. Depending on your virtualization software, the settings may differ.
In this example, we show the option for `Proxmox` / `KVM`.

Currently, no CPU type is set for the VM and the type `Default kvm64` is used.

![Default CPU-Type Default kvm64](/images/openitcockpit5/pve_default_kvm64.png)

Change the CPU type to `host` or `x86-64-v2-AES`, save the changes, and power the VM off and on again.
Afterwards, the problem should be resolved.

![Default CPU-Type x86-64-v2-AES](/images/openitcockpit5/pve_x86-64-v2-AES.png)

##### Success

If the MySQL server can be started successfully, you will receive output like this and the MySQL server will automatically terminate:

```bash
docker run --rm -it mysql:latest

2025-05-13 14:37:28+00:00 [Note] [Entrypoint]: Entrypoint script for MySQL Server 9.3.0-1.el9 started.
2025-05-13 14:37:29+00:00 [Note] [Entrypoint]: Switching to dedicated user 'mysql'
2025-05-13 14:37:29+00:00 [Note] [Entrypoint]: Entrypoint script for MySQL Server 9.3.0-1.el9 started.
2025-05-13 14:37:29+00:00 [ERROR] [Entrypoint]: Database is uninitialized and password option is not specified
    You need to specify one of the following as an environment variable:
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
    - MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD
    - MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD
```

In this case, your system is not affected and you can ignore the troubleshooting steps.

#### If your openITCOCKPIT version is < 4.8.7

For the update process to complete successfully, you must be using at least version 4.8.7 of openITCOCKPIT.


#### What if I use Ubuntu Bionic, Debian Buster or openITCOCKPIT 3?

Please get in [touch with us](https://it-services.it-novum.com/en/).
