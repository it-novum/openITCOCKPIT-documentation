# openITCOCKPIT-Desktop
The openITCOCKPIT desktop app is a standalone application that can be installed on any modern operating system and provides an overview of current monitoring events and status updates. openITCOCKPIT desktop uses the openITCOCKPIT HTTP API to communicate with the openITCOCKPIT server.

## Dashboard
![dashboard](../images/oitc-desktop/desktop-app-dashboard.png)

The dashboard consists of the overview page plus further views (alarms, status pages) that can be reached over the tabs in the top right.

#### Overview
The first section of the dashboard overview shows the total congestion of the hosts and services. This section is always available.
You can go into more detail by clicking on the corresponding entries.

#### Resource overview widget *
![dashboard](../images/oitc-desktop/desktop-scm-widget.png)
If the user has a resource overview widget in his ***openITCOCKPIT Server Dashboard***, this will also be displayed on this page - straight after the general overview section. By clicking on the corresponding status entries (greater than 0), you can delve into the corresponding resources.

!!! info
    The Resource overview widget only appears on the mobile dashboard overview if it is also present in the openITCOCKPIT Server Dashboard.


#### Takctical Overviews
If tactical overviews are configured in the server dashboard of the user, they are also displayed here.
Clicking the corresponding entries can be deepened.

#### Changeclendar
If change calendars are defined on the server to which the logged-in user has access, these are also displayed here
The display of the individual calendars can be configured.

#### Top Alerts(Notifications)
![dashboard](../images/oitc-desktop/desktop-top-alerts.png)

The notifications of the last 24 hours are displayed here with their status.
The respective widget contains a list that can be scrolled through.
The list is sorted according to the number and the last (current date) of the notification(s). Number here does not mean the number of contacts notified,
but the number of notifications for this host (service) itself.
Clicking on the corresponding host(service) links to the notification log view, where you can then see which contacts have been notified and how.
#### Statusseiten
![dashboard](../images/oitc-desktop/desktop-statuspages.png)

If status pages are configured in the OITC backend, they are sorted here according to the highest cumulative status (see reporting-> status pages).

### Tray
![tray](../images/oitc-desktop/tray.png)
Some settings can also be made via the tray icon (right-click).

## Customization
The openITCOCKPIT desktop application is able to adapt to the identity of the respective company.
For this case the app icon (application bar, tray, widget), the logo of the login page and the background image of the login page can be changed.
![assets](../images/oitc-desktop/custom-assets.png)

To do this, a folder named **customAssets** must be created (linked) within the configuration directory of the application.

Depending on the operating system, the configuration directory is in the following locations:

Windows
```bash
c:\Benutzer\<user>\AppData\Roaming\openITCOCKIT-Desktop
```
OSX
```bash
/users/<user>/Library/Application Support/openITCOCKIT-Desktop
```
Linux
```bash
/home/<user>/.config/openITCOCKIT-Desktop
```

### customAssets
Within the customAssets folder, the following file naming conventions must be observed:

**Icon**: favicon.png
Only png as Endung allowed.
Depending on the operating system, the dimensions should be slightly different:
Windows: min. 64x64, better 256x256
Linux: same as  Windows
OSX: max. 32x32, better 16x16 - otherwise the icon at the top of the bar will be too big.

**logo**: logo.png (.svg,.jpg)
Any resolution, since it is scaled

**background**: background.png (.svg, .jpg)
Resolution in principle also arbitrary, since it is scaled, but it should be at least FullHD.
