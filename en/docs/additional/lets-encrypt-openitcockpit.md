# How to Configure Let's Encrypt SSL Certificates for openITCOCKPIT

This documentation explains how to secure your openITCOCKPIT installation with SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt.

!!! note

    This guide assumes that openITCOCKPIT is the only application running on the server.
    If you are running multiple different web applications on your server, we recommend using a
    reverse proxy to terminate all SSL connections there.

## Prerequisites

- To use Let's Encrypt, the system must be accessible from the Internet.
- The system must have a domain or subdomain like `next.openitcockpit.io`.

## Installing Certbot

Issuing Let's Encrypt certificates can be done using various tools. For openITCOCKPIT itself, it does not matter which tool
manages the SSL certificate.

This documentation uses Certbot to manage the Let's Encrypt certificate.

First, install Certbot as described in the [official documentation](https://certbot.eff.org/). We recommend the `snap`-based installation.
Select `Nginx` as the web server and `Linux (snap)` as the operating system, then follow the instructions.

## Issuing a new certificate

An SSL certificate can easily be created using Certbot. You only need to adjust the domain name `next.openitcockpit.io` to match your domain.

```
certbot certonly --nginx -d next.openitcockpit.io
```

If you are running Certbot for the first time, some prompts will appear, such as entering an email address. It is recommended to answer these questions with valid information.

Upon success, you will see the following output. Copy the file paths of the two files into a text editor. These will be needed in the next step.
```
Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/next.openitcockpit.io/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/next.openitcockpit.io/privkey.pem
```

## Loading the Certificates

Next, the SSL certificate must be configured in the Nginx web server. Open the file `/etc/nginx/openitc/ssl_cert.conf` and add the Let's Encrypt-issued certificate as shown in the following example:

To apply the changes, restart the Nginx web server.

```
systemctl restart nginx
```

openITCOCKPIT is now secured with the Let's Encrypt certificate. You can verify this using your web browser.

## Testing Automatic Renewal

Let's Encrypt certificates have a lifespan of 90 days. Certbot automatically renews the certificate, but it is recommended to verify the renewal process once.

You can test the automatic renewal with the following command:

```
certbot renew --dry-run
```

## Monitoring the Certificate (Optional)

It is recommended to monitor the certificate in openITCOCKPIT. This step is optional.

The easiest way to monitor the certificate is by using the plugin [matteocorti/check_ssl_cert](https://github.com/matteocorti/check_ssl_cert/releases) and the [openITCOCKPIT Monitoring Agent](/beginners/openitcockpit-agent/).

### Installing check_ssl_cert

Download the plugin [matteocorti/check_ssl_cert](https://github.com/matteocorti/check_ssl_cert/releases) in `.tar.gz` format and extract it.

```
wget https://github.com/matteocorti/check_ssl_cert/releases/download/v2.84.5/check_ssl_cert-2.84.5.tar.gz
tar xfv check_ssl_cert-2.84.5.tar.gz

cp check_ssl_cert-2.84.5/check_ssl_cert /opt/openitc/nagios/libexec/
```

### Setting Up a Custom Check

The plugin is executed via the openITCOCKPIT Monitoring Agent. Create a new check in the file `/etc/openitcockpit-agent/customchecks.ini`.

```ini
[SSL Certificate]
  command = /opt/openitc/nagios/libexec/check_ssl_cert -H localhost -f /etc/letsencrypt/live/next.openitcockpit.io/cert.pem -r /etc/letsencrypt/live/next.openitcockpit.io/fullchain.pem --warning 15 --critical 5
  interval = 3600
  timeout = 5
  enabled = true
```

To apply the changes, restart the Monitoring Agent. Note that file paths may need to be adjusted.

```
systemctl restart openitcockpit-agent.service
```

The custom check can then be added to openITCOCKPIT using the wizard.

openITCOCKPIT will now monitor the lifespan of the certificate.
