## Dark theme
openITCOCKPIT Mobile provides a dark theme by default. You can switch between the light and dark theme via the main menu.

![Light and dark theme](/images/mobile-website/mobile_light_and_dark.png)

## Customization

The mobile website is able to adapt to the identity of the respective company. This affects the login logo, header logo
(top menu bar), favicon, systemname (top menu bar) and the website title.

To do this, a directory must be created on the host system in which the corresponding files are stored on **the same**
level.

- `CustomConfigDir/`
    * `HeaderLogo.png`
    * `LoginLogo.png`
    * `interface.yml`
    * `favicon.png`

The file `interface.yml` is the corresponding configuration file, which contains all configurable parameters. You will
an example of the file in the repository [interface.example.yml](https://github.com/it-novum/openITCOCKPIT-Mobile/blob/development/interface/interface.example.yml).

In order to take effect you will need to add the following parameter with your custom directory to the docker
commandline:

```bash
-v /my/path/to/CustomConfigDir:/var/www/localhost/htdocs/interface
```

It should be noted, that the internal path:

`:/var/www/localhost/htdocs/interface` stays the same in every case!

Changes can be done during the runtime in the `CustomConfigDir/interface.yml` file. No restart of the docker container
required.

### Example configuration

This is an example configuration to illustrate how a configuration of the `interface.yml` file affects the mobile
website.

This example was inspired by the [Halloween theme](https://github.com/it-novum/oitc-halloween-theme) for openITCOCKPIT.

![ci-login](/images/mobile-website/ci-login.png){ width="300"}


Configuration of the `interface.yml`:

```yaml
############
# CUSTOM INTERFACE CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE
# All attributes are optional.
# Custom images needs to be placed in the same directory as this configuration file
############

# System name displayed in the website header
systemname: Spooky Monitoring

# Title of the Website
title: custom title

# Logo used on the Login Screen
# filename only! - the complete path will be set automatically
login_logo: openitcockpit_halloween.png

# Filename of a custom background image used by the login screen.
# It is recommended to compress the used image https://tinypng.com/.
# Compression can reduce the filesize up to 70%. The image should have a resolution of 2560x1440px
# filename only! - the complete path will be set automatically
login_bg: ben-mccloskey-wN_UDPOTC1w-unsplash.jpg

# Logo used on the main manu
# filename only! - the complete path will be set automatically
header_logo: ghost_emoji.png

# Determine if openITCOCKPIT Mobile should use one image for all favicons
# (one icon for all Desktop Browsers, Mobile Devices, Operating Systems)
# of if openITCOCKPIT Mobile should use specialized icons for all kind of platforms
# true = one icon for all platforms (not recommended)
# false = Specializes icons per platform (recommended)
simple_favicon: false

# favicon logo
# filename only! - the complete path will be set automatically
# This is only relevant if "simple_favicon" is set to true
# If you want to use favicons per platform use the Website https://realfavicongenerator.net/
# to generate all required files and pass the folder to the container
# More information can be found in the docs: https://docs.openitcockpit.io/en/additional/mobile-website/
favicon: favicon.ico

# Theme color
# Some mobile browsers support to set a so called theme-color, which defines the color of the address bar
# or other parts of the browser itself.
# https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name/theme-color
# If you want to adjust this value, it is recommended to set "simple_favicon" to false and to pass own favicons as well.
# The files "favicons/browserconfig.xml" and "favicons/site.webmanifest" to also contain the colors and have to be
# adjusted manually.
theme_color: '#4085c6'

# FQDN or IP-Address of your openITCOCKPIT Server
# If this value is defined, users have no option anymore to set the ip-address on the login screen.
server_url: demo.openitcockpit.io
```

### Favicons

Favicons are icons that the browser will for bookmarks or in the menu of currently opened tabs.
Different browsers and operating systems support different types of favicons. For example there are specialized icons if a
bookmark gets created to the home screen of mobile devices.

### Multiple favicons (recommended)
As mentioned above different browsers on different operating systems support different Favicons. iOS and Android devices for example have a separate icon for home screen shortcuts.
Microsoft Windows requires a tile icon and last but not least Safari and macOS which requires own icons for the tab and touch bar.

The easiest way to get all required favicons is to use a online generator like [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).

The base path of all Favicons is `/favicons/`.
The following example screenshots shows how to use the ghost emoji 👻 as favicon.

![Usage example of RealFaviconGenerator](/images/mobile-website/realfavicongenerator_usage_example.png){ width="300"}


If you have used [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) you can simply extract all files from the downloaded archive file into a folder called `favicons`.

Please make sure that your folder contains all the required files:

- `android-chrome-192x192.png`
- `android-chrome-512x512.png`
- `apple-touch-icon.png`
- `browserconfig.xml`
- `favicon.ico`
- `favicon-16x16.png`
- `favicon-32x32.png`
- `mstile-150x150.png`
- `safari-pinned-tab.svg`
- `site.webmanifest`

To apply the changes, make sure that `simple_favicon` is set to `false` in your `interface.yml`. (default)
Also pass the `favicons` to to contianer like so
```
-v /host/path/to/favicons:/var/www/localhost/htdocs/webroot/favicons:ro
```

### Simple favicon

It is also possible to use one favicon for all platforms. **This is not recommended** and especially for mobile devices is a bad practice.

Set `simple_favicon` is set to `true` and the file name at `favicon` in your `interface.yml`.
Please make sure the file is a Microsoft Windows Icon (`.ico`)
