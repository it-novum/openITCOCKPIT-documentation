# Docker images

The official Docker images of openITCOCKPIT are available here:

 - [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/openitcockpit/openitcockpit-ce)

The Docker images of openITCOCKPIT are available for the `amd64` and `arm64` CPU architectures and can also be used on a SoC like the Raspberry Pi 4.

## Requirements

Docker and Docker Compose are required. Please follow the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/),
if you do not have Docker installed yet.

## Settings
The configuration of openITCOCKPIT can be customized via the `openitcockpit.env` file. It is recommended,
to change the login data **before the first start of the container**:

```sh
OITC_ADMIN_EMAIL=user@example.org
OITC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=asdf12
OITC_ADMIN_FIRSTNAME=John
OITC_ADMIN_LASTNAME=Doe
```

Alternatively, you can also create a new [user](https://docs.openitcockpit.io/en/configuration/usermanagement/) or change the password.

It is also recommended to replace the password of Grafana admin user. To do this, set the following two variables to the same value:
```sh
OITC_GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=bGsPMxURCjg4esgJ

GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=bGsPMxURCjg4esgJ
```

To generate a secure password, the command `pwgen -s -1 16` can be used.

As usual with Docker containers, other settings like ports or volumes can be adjusted in the `compose.yml` if needed.

## Default values

By default, openITCOCKPIT provides these ports:

 - 80 (HTTP)
 - 443 (HTTPS)

The default login credentials are:

 - E-Mail `user@example.org`
 - Password: `asdf12`

## Preparations

1. The easiest way to check out fully containerized openITCOCKPIT is to use `git` to create a local copy of the repository that contains all the data you need.
```
git clone https://github.com/it-novum/openITCOCKPIT-ce-docker.git
```

2. Change to docker directory
```
cd openITCOCKPIT-ce-docker
```

3. Edit `openitcockpit.env` file and change the values username an password.

## Start containers

The containers are started with the help of the command
```
docker compose up -d
```


## Update containers

To update the containers of openITCOCKPIT, please follow these steps:

1. Update the local copy of your repository:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

2. Stop running containers
```bash
docker compose down
```

3. Run the Docker compose command to update and launch the containers:
```bash
docker compose up --pull always -d
```

## Tags

The Docker registry of openITCOCKPIT includes the following tags for all containers:

- `latest` - latest stabel version of openITCOCKPIT (recommended)
- A version such as `4.6.4` - These tags contain the specified version of openITCOCKPIT and can be used to obtain a specific stable version.

- `nightly` - An **untested** build of openITCOCKPIT which has been automatically created and released. Can be used for testing new versions and features. **Not intended for production use!**


## Troubleshooting

### Execute commands in a container

1. Run the `docker ps` command to read the ID of the desired container.
2. In the next step, you need to 'jump' into the container using the `docker exec` command.
```
docker exec -it d92a1431e619 bash
```

### Starting MySQL console

1. 'Jump' into the `openitcockpit-ce` container with the `docker exec` command.
2. Run the command `mysql --defaults-file=/opt/openitc/etc/mysql/mysql.cnf` to get a MySQL shell.

### Query Gearman status
1. 'Jump' into the `openitcockpit-ce` container with the `docker exec` command.
2. Run the command `gearadmin --status -h gearmand` to get a gearman status output.

If you have customized the hostname of the gearman job server, you can read the value directly from the environment variable: `gearadmin --status -h $OITC_GEARMAN_ADDRESS`.

### Restarting services
Normally, you do not have to restart services manually. However, via the `openitcockpit-ce` container it is possible to restart certain services in other containers.
The `oitc supervisor --help` command can be used for this.

Examples:
```
oitc supervisor status naemon
oitc supervisor restart nginx
oitc supervisor stop nginx
oitc supervisor start nginx
```

## Install your own monitoring plugins

The container `openitcockpit/mod_gearman_worker` is responsible for running monitoring plugins. This container is always based on
the current LTS version of Ubuntu and can be used as a base image for new containers.

Therefore, you must first create your own `Dockerfile`, which will install all the plugins you want. In this example, the container will be extended with the plugin
[check_ssl_cert](https://github.com/matteocorti/check_ssl_cert).

```Dockerfile
FROM openitcockpit/mod_gearman_worker:latest

USER root

# Install plugin dependencies
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND noninteractive
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y perl wget curl bind9-host bc openssl nmap

# Install the plugin
RUN wget https://github.com/matteocorti/check_ssl_cert/releases/download/v2.69.0/check_ssl_cert-2.69.0.tar.gz &&\
    tar xfv check_ssl_cert-2.69.0.tar.gz &&\
    cp check_ssl_cert-2.69.0/check_ssl_cert /opt/openitc/nagios/libexec/check_ssl_cert &&\
    chmod +x /opt/openitc/nagios/libexec/check_ssl_cert

```


Create the new Docker image:
```
docker build --rm -t openitcockpit/custom_mod_gearman_worker:latest .
```

The last step is to add your own Docker image to the `compose.yml` file. Find the container `openitcockpit/mod_gearman_worker` and replace the image with your own.
image with your own, for example `openitcockpit/custom_mod_gearman_worker:latest`.


After restarting the containers, your custom container will be used.
```
[Ubuntu][11:49]root@srvcontainerswarm04/tmp/custom_mod_gearman# docker exec -it dffc5ffe8681 bash
root@dffc5ffe8681:/# /opt/openitc/nagios/libexec/check_ssl_cert -H openitcockpit.io
SSL_CERT OK - openitcockpit.io:443, https, x509 certificate 'openitcockpit.io' from 'Let's Encrypt' valid until Aug  6 21:32:16 2023 GMT (expires in 76 days)|days_chain_elem1=76;20;15;; days_chain_elem2=847;20;15;; days_chain_elem3=497;20;15;;

```


## Portainer

[Portainer Community Edition](https://github.com/portainer/portainer) is a web interface that makes it convenient and easy to manage Docker containers.

Through _Stacks_, the Portainer interface allows you to manage Docker Compose files. To do this, click `Add stack` under `Stacks`.

1. As name you can set `openitcockpit-ce`.

2. You can either add the [Docker Compose File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/it-novum/openITCOCKPIT-ce-docker/main/compose.yml) via the web editor, or alternatively get it directly from the GitHub repository `https://github.com/it-novum/openITCOCKPIT-ce-docker`.

    **Please note** that all references to the `openitcockpit.env` file must be replaced by `stack.env`.

    To do this, look for these entries
    ```
    env_file:
     - openitcockpit.env
    ```

    Replace with
    ```
    env_file:
     - stack.env
    ```

    You can do this with the help of the web editor. (`CTRL + F` or `CMD + F`)
    ![Find and replace openitcockpit.env with stack.env](/images/docker/portainer_stack_env.png)

3. Under `Environment variables` select `Advanced mode` and copy the contents of the file [openitcockpit.env](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/it-novum/openITCOCKPIT-ce-docker/main/openitcockpit.env).
    Alternatively, you can select `Load variables from .env file` then upload the file `openitcockpit.env`.

4. Click on `Deploy the stack`
    Portainer will now create the complete stack and start all containers.

## Startup process

The startup process of the openITCOCKPIT container can take some time. The container checks the state of the database at each startup and performs any updates.
As soon as the openITCOCKPIT frontend is accessible, the container outputs the message `openITCOCKPIT is now ready`.
