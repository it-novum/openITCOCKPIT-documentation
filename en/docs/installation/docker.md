# Docker images

The official Docker images of openITCOCKPIT are available here:

 - [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/openitcockpit/openitcockpit-ce)

The Docker images of openITCOCKPIT are available for the `amd64` and `arm64` CPU architectures and can also be used on a SoC like the Raspberry Pi 4.

## Requirements

Docker and Docker Compose are required. Please follow the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/),
if you do not have Docker installed yet.

### System requirements
- 2 CPU cores (x86-64 or arm64)
- 2 GB RAM
- 40 GB of free hard disk space

!!! info
    The amount of disk space used depends on the number of monitored hosts and services.

## Settings
The configuration of openITCOCKPIT can be customized via the `openitcockpit.env` file. It is recommended,
to change the login data **before the first start of the container**:

```sh
OITC_ADMIN_EMAIL=user@example.org
OITC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=asdf12
OITC_ADMIN_FIRSTNAME=John
OITC_ADMIN_LASTNAME=Doe
```

Alternatively, you can also create a new [user](https://docs.openitcockpit.io/en/configuration/usermanagement/) or change the password.

It is also recommended to replace the password of Grafana admin user. To do this, set the following two variables to the same value:
```sh
OITC_GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=bGsPMxURCjg4esgJ

GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=bGsPMxURCjg4esgJ
```

To generate a secure password, the command `pwgen -s -1 16` can be used.

As usual with Docker containers, other settings like ports or volumes can be adjusted in the `compose.yml` if needed.

## Default values

By default, openITCOCKPIT provides these ports:

 - 80 (HTTP)
 - 443 (HTTPS)

The default login credentials are:

 - E-Mail `user@example.org`
 - Password: `asdf12`

## Preparations

1. The easiest way to check out fully containerized openITCOCKPIT is to use `git` to create a local copy of the repository that contains all the data you need.
```
git clone https://github.com/it-novum/openITCOCKPIT-ce-docker.git
```

2. Change to docker directory
```
cd openITCOCKPIT-ce-docker
```

3. Edit `openitcockpit.env` file and change the values username an password.

## Start containers

The containers are started with the help of the command
```
docker compose up -d
```


## Update containers

To update the containers of openITCOCKPIT, please follow these steps:

1. Update the local copy of your repository:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

2. Stop running containers
```bash
docker compose down
```

3. Run the Docker compose command to update and launch the containers:
```bash
docker compose up --pull always -d
```

## Tags

The Docker registry of openITCOCKPIT includes the following tags for all containers:

- `latest` - latest stable version of openITCOCKPIT (recommended)
- A version such as `4.6.4` - These tags contain the specified version of openITCOCKPIT and can be used to obtain a specific stable version.

- `nightly` - An **untested** build of openITCOCKPIT which has been automatically created and released. Can be used for testing new versions and features. **Not intended for production use!**


## Troubleshooting

### Execute commands in a container

1. Run the `docker ps` command to read the ID of the desired container.
2. In the next step, you need to 'jump' into the container using the `docker exec` command.
```
docker exec -it d92a1431e619 bash
```

### Starting MySQL console

1. 'Jump' into the `openitcockpit-ce` container with the `docker exec` command.
2. Run the command `mysql --defaults-file=/opt/openitc/etc/mysql/mysql.cnf` to get a MySQL shell.

### Query Gearman status
1. 'Jump' into the `openitcockpit-ce` container with the `docker exec` command.
2. Run the command `gearadmin --status -h gearmand` to get a gearman status output.

If you have customized the hostname of the gearman job server, you can read the value directly from the environment variable: `gearadmin --status -h $OITC_GEARMAN_ADDRESS`.

### Restarting services
Normally, you do not have to restart services manually. However, via the `openitcockpit-ce` container it is possible to restart certain services in other containers.
The `oitc supervisor --help` command can be used for this.

Examples:
```
oitc supervisor status naemon
oitc supervisor restart nginx
oitc supervisor stop nginx
oitc supervisor start nginx
```

## Install your own monitoring plugins
openITCOCKPIT supports two different methods to extend the monitoring capabilities with custom check plugins. The _containerized method_
is recommended for users that have experience with building and maintaining container images.

If you prefer a bare-metal server or virtual machine for this have a look at the _traditional method_.

### Containerized method

The container `openitcockpit/mod_gearman_worker` is responsible for running monitoring plugins. This container is always based on
the current LTS version of Ubuntu and can be used as a base image for new containers.

Therefore, you must first create your own `Dockerfile`, which will install all the plugins you want. In this example, the container will be extended with the plugin
[check_ssl_cert](https://github.com/matteocorti/check_ssl_cert).

```Dockerfile
FROM openitcockpit/mod_gearman_worker:latest

USER root

# Install plugin dependencies
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND noninteractive
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y perl wget curl bind9-host bc openssl nmap

# Install the plugin
RUN wget https://github.com/matteocorti/check_ssl_cert/releases/download/v2.69.0/check_ssl_cert-2.69.0.tar.gz &&\
    tar xfv check_ssl_cert-2.69.0.tar.gz &&\
    cp check_ssl_cert-2.69.0/check_ssl_cert /opt/openitc/nagios/libexec/check_ssl_cert &&\
    chmod +x /opt/openitc/nagios/libexec/check_ssl_cert

```


Create the new Docker image:
```
docker build --rm -t openitcockpit/custom_mod_gearman_worker:latest .
```

The last step is, to add your own Docker image to the `compose.yml` file. Find the container `openitcockpit/mod_gearman_worker` and replace the image with your ownimage.
For example: `openitcockpit/custom_mod_gearman_worker:latest`.


After restarting the containers, your custom container will be used.
```
[Ubuntu][11:49]root@srvcontainerswarm04/tmp/custom_mod_gearman# docker exec -it dffc5ffe8681 bash
root@dffc5ffe8681:/# /opt/openitc/nagios/libexec/check_ssl_cert -H openitcockpit.io
SSL_CERT OK - openitcockpit.io:443, https, x509 certificate 'openitcockpit.io' from 'Let's Encrypt' valid until Aug  6 21:32:16 2023 GMT (expires in 76 days)|days_chain_elem1=76;20;15;; days_chain_elem2=847;20;15;; days_chain_elem3=497;20;15;;
root@dffc5ffe8681:/#
```

### Traditional method

openITCOCKPIT make use of `Mod-Gearman` to distribute the execution of check plugins across multiple servers (or containers).

If you don't feel comfortable by building and maintaining your own container image, openITCOCKPIT provides a package, so you can use any Debian, Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux based system as a worker system.
Depending on your workload, it could make sense to spin-up multiple worker instances.

!!! warning
    For security reasons we highly recommend to <a href="#enabling-encryption">enable encryption</a>.

#### Prepare containers
First you need to prepare your current container setup a bit.

1. Expose Gearmand

    To be able to connect an external Mod-Gearman Worker to openITCOCKPIT, you have to expose the `Gearman-Job-Server` to your network.
    First, edit the file `compose.yml` and search for the `gearmand` service. Replace the line
    ```
    - "4730"       # Gearman-Job-Server
    ```

    with
    ```
    - "4730:4730"       # Gearman-Job-Server
    ```

2. Disable processing of host and service checks of openITCOCKPIT

    To make sure that all host and services checks get executed by your own custom worker,
    it is important to disable the default check execution of openITCOCKPIT. To do so, edit the file `openitcockpit.env`
    and set the following values:
    ```cfg
    #####
    ## Naemon Environment Variables
    #####

    MOD_GEARMAN_ENCRYPTION=yes
    MOD_GEARMAN_KEY=should_be_changed

    #####
    ## Mod_Gearman_Worker Environment Variables
    #####
    MOD_GEARMAN_WORKER_EVENTHANDLER=no
    MOD_GEARMAN_WORKER_NOTIFICATIONS=yes
    MOD_GEARMAN_WORKER_SERVICES=no
    MOD_GEARMAN_WORKER_HOSTS=no
    MOD_GEARMAN_WORKER_ENCRYPTION=yes
    MOD_GEARMAN_WORKER_KEY=should_be_changed
    ```

    To apply the changes, restart the containers.
    The `openitcockpit/mod_gearman_worker` container will still be used to send notifications.
    This behavior can also be changed, but to do so is only recommended for power users.

#### Prepare VM
Now it is time to setup a VM (or server) which you want to use for check execution.
We recommend to start with a blank VM of the latest Ubuntu LTS release.

1. Load the repository.

    Please make sure to enable the [openITCOCKPIT repository](https://openitcockpit.io/download_server/) on your system.

2. Install dependencies
    ```
    apt-get install openitcockpit-mod-gearman-worker-go
    ```

    All check plugins are located at `/opt/openitc/nagios/libexec`. You can add any custom plugin you need to this (or any other) location.

3. Connect worker to openITCOCKPIT Server

    Open the file `/etc/openitcockpit-mod-gearman/worker.cfg` and set the hostname or IP-Address of your openITCOCKPIT Server.
    ```cfg
    server=srvpod03.example.org:4730

    # Also make sure to set same encryption parameters
    encryption=yes
    key=should_be_changed
    ```

    To apply the settings, restart the service: `systemctl restart mod-gearman-worker.service`

### Enabling encryption
By default, openITCOCKPIT **has no encryption enabled** for Mod-Gearman. This is due to the fact, that by default all communication
is only available through the containers that are part of the same container network.

In case you have exposed the Gearman Port (4730) or are using any external Mod-Gearman Workers, we recommend to enable encryption.
Mod-Gearman has a shared secret, so you need to make the changes on all affected systems!

For containers edit the file `openitcockpit.env` and adjust the following variables:
```
#####
## Naemon Environment Variables
#####

MOD_GEARMAN_ENCRYPTION=yes
MOD_GEARMAN_KEY=should_be_changed

#####
## Mod_Gearman_Worker Environment Variables
#####

MOD_GEARMAN_WORKER_ENCRYPTION=yes
MOD_GEARMAN_WORKER_KEY=should_be_changed
```

For traditional setups, edit the configuration file `/etc/openitcockpit-mod-gearman/worker.cfg`:
```
encryption=yes
key=should_be_changed
```

The `key` option contains the shared secret and should be replaced with a secure string.

To apply the changes restart all containers or the `mod-gearman-worker.service`.

## Portainer

[Portainer Community Edition](https://github.com/portainer/portainer) is a web interface that makes it convenient and easy to manage Docker containers.

Through _Stacks_, the Portainer interface allows you to manage Docker Compose files. To do this, click `Add stack` under `Stacks`.

1. As name you can set `openitcockpit-ce`.

2. You can either add the [Docker Compose File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/it-novum/openITCOCKPIT-ce-docker/main/compose.yml) via the web editor, or alternatively get it directly from the GitHub repository `https://github.com/it-novum/openITCOCKPIT-ce-docker`.

    **Please note** that all references to the `openitcockpit.env` file must be replaced by `stack.env`.

    To do this, look for these entries
    ```
    env_file:
     - openitcockpit.env
    ```

    Replace with
    ```
    env_file:
     - stack.env
    ```

    You can do this with the help of the web editor. (`CTRL + F` or `CMD + F`)
    ![Find and replace openitcockpit.env with stack.env](/images/docker/portainer_stack_env.png)

3. Under `Environment variables` select `Advanced mode` and copy the contents of the file [openitcockpit.env](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/it-novum/openITCOCKPIT-ce-docker/main/openitcockpit.env).
    Alternatively, you can select `Load variables from .env file` then upload the file `openitcockpit.env`.
    ![Portainer Stack configuration for openITCOCKPIT](/images/docker/portainer_create_stack.png)


4. Click on `Deploy the stack`
    Portainer will now create the complete stack and start all containers.
    ![Portainer running stack](/images/docker/portainer_stack_running.png)

## Startup process

The startup process of the openITCOCKPIT container can take some time. The container checks the state of the database at each startup and performs any updates.
As soon as the openITCOCKPIT frontend is accessible, the container outputs the message `openITCOCKPIT is now ready`.

### Docker
![openITCOCKPIT is ready via Docker Compose](/images/docker/docker_ready.png)

### Portainer

## MySQL Binary Log
By default, the binary log of the MySQL server is disabled in the `compose.yml` file.
The binary log is required for replication between multiple MySQL servers but can also be useful in case of database recovery.
Further information can be found in the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/binary-log.html).

If you want to enable the binary log, you need to remove the `--skip-log-bin` parameter from the `compose.yml` file. The retention period of the binary logs can be controlled by the
`--binlog-expire-logs-seconds=2592000` parameter, which is set to 30 days by default.
