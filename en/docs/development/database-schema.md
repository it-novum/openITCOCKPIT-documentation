!!! Danger "Danger"

    Changes in the database can negatively affect the stability of the system
    and cause problems, especially when installing updates. 

    The database access should be **read only**. 

The database schema of openITCOCKPIT consists of ~190 tables. Many of these tables are interrelated. 

To provide developers an overview of the database, the database schema is available in DBML (Database Markup Language) format.
