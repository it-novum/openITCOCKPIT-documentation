# Nightly Repository

!!! warning
    The Nightly Repository contains **automatically created** and **untested** builds of openITCOCKPIT.
    It is strongly recommended that the Nightly Repository is only used for test and development systems.

For openITCOCKPIT are two update channels available: **stable** and **nightly**. By default, openITCOCKPIT is always using the stable channel.

To test new features before the next stable release is available, you can change to the openITCOCKPIT nightly repository. It get's updated at irregular intervals and always contains the current version of openITCOCKPIT build from source. The builds are done automatically and published **without prior testing**!
