# Reporting

As you would expect, openITCOCKPIT includes a reporting function. These reports can contain a wide variety of data such as maintenance times, failures, downtimes and the current status of individual hosts and services.

## Instant reports

Instant reports in openITCOCKPIT are a reporting function that can be generated as HTML or PDF files and optionally sent at a user-defined interval.

Instant reports also contain a summary of the status of hosts, services, host groups or service groups, depending on the options selected.

### Generating an instant report

To generate an instant report, first click the “New” button in the “Instant Reports” overview.

Then select a container, assign a name and then select the object type to be evaluated.

Depending on the object type selected, you can then select either hosts, host groups, services or service groups you would like to report on.

The time range indicates the period of time over which the evaluation should take place.

The reflection state defines whether either both a hard and soft state or only a hard state should be taken into account.

You have the option to take maintenance times into account in your reporting by selecting the “Include downtimes” option.

If the option “Display summary ” is selected, instead of listing individual hosts and their services, only an overview of the status of the host and its services will be displayed.

If you want to automatically send a report every day, week, month or year, the “Send email” option must be activated.

Once this option has been enabled, you can send reports to one or more users.

and then on the “Generate” button (2).

![](/images/instantreports-generate.png)

In the form that opens, choose the report format and the period you want the report to cover.
The report will then be displayed in the browser or made available for download.

## Current state report

The “Current State Report” generates a report in HTML or PDF format based on the services selected.

In addition to the status filter functions, you can also filter according to confirmations, maintenance times and the type of test used.

The generated report also contains the host status of the selected services as well as the various metrics (performance data) of the services.

| Field         | Required                  | Description                       |

## Downtime reports

Downtime reports in openITCOCKPIT provide information about which hosts or which hosts and services were undergoing maintenance and when. This is displayed visually using a calendar and diagrams system.

### Creating a downtime report

To create a downtime report, click on “Downtime reports” in the main menu.

There you can select whether only hosts or hosts and services should be evaluated.

You can choose from two report formats: an HTML report that is displayed in the browser or a PDF report that can be downloaded.

The period defines which downtimes should be taken into account.

The reflection state defines whether either both a soft and hard state or only a hard state should be taken into account.

| Field            | Required                  | Description                                                  |

## Autoreports <span class="badge badge-primary badge-outlined" title="Community Edition">CE</span>

The autoreport module in openITCOCKPIT is a configurable report that can be sent out automatically. Reports contain the length of downtime, the maximum permissible downtime and the availability of the hosts and services that have been selected.

### Creating an autoreport

To create an autoreport, first click on the “New” button in the autoreports overview.

The autoreport Wizard opens and will guide you through the steps for creating a report.

First select a container for the report and then assign a name to it.

Then select a period to use for the evaluation.

The evaluation period defines when the evaluation should begin.

The send interval defines how often the report should be sent.

You can then enter either the guaranteed availability (as a percentage) or the maximum number of outages you're willing to accept.

The graphs displayed can be given either in percent or hours. This is defined by making the appropriate selection in the “Graph” field.

The reflection state defines whether either both a soft and hard state or only a hard state should be taken into account.

So that maintenance times are not displayed as downtimes in the report, you can activate the “Consider downtimes” option.

To account for public holidays, you will need to activate the option “View public holidays” and then select a calendar.

At least one user must also be selected so that the report can be sent out.

Now select the hosts to be evaluated in the report.

An overview of the services for all the selected hosts will appear. Here you can choose how the selected items should be evaluated.

In the last step you will see an overview of the settings you have configured for the report. If you are satisfied with all your selections, click "Done" and the configuration will be complete.

The report will now automatically be sent at the specified time. However, you also have the option of generating the report directly as a PDF or HTML file. To do this, click on the “Generate report” option in the menu for the corresponding report.

From here you can select the output format and the time range to be evaluated. After clicking on “Generate report” you will either be offered the option to download the report as a PDF file or have it displayed directly in the browser as an HTML file.
