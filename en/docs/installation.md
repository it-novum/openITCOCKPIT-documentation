## Installing openITCOCKPIT
The actual installation is carried out by executing the following command:
```
apt-get install openitcockpit
```

You will now need to perform  the basic configuration. During this process, for example, the first user for the web interface will be created. The rest of the configuration is then carried out via the openITCOCKPIT web interface.

```
/opt/openitc/frontend/SETUP.sh
```

## Registering the openITCOCKPIT Community Edition

This step is optional and voluntary. You can expand your openITCOCKPIT installation's range of functions through the addition of modules. Several are available for free. In order to gain access to the community modules, you must first enter the openITCOCKPIT community key. To do this, click on `System -> Registration` and insert the following key: `e5aef99e-817b-0ff5-3f0e-140c1f342792`.

No further information is required.

After being successfully activated, the community modules will be available under `System Tools -> Package Manager`.

## Installing phpMyAdmin

This step is optional and voluntary. The openITCOCKPIT system uses a MySQL database. Generally speaking, end users will not directly interact with the database. Experienced users, however, can install the `phpMyAdmin` tool for managing the database.

```
apt-get install phpmyadmin
```

The web server will be configured automatically. The phpMyAdmin interface can then be reached via `https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/phpmyadmin`.

- Ubuntu Linux 64 bit,  Debian Linux 64 bit, RHEL 64 bit
