> :information_source: If you only want to improve the documentation, please use the Docker setup as descripted above.

1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/it-novum/openITCOCKPIT-documentation.git
cd openITCOCKPIT-documentation/
```

2. Build Docker image
```
docker build . -t openitcockpit/mkdocs
```

3. Build all languages
```
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/docs -w /docs/de -p 8000:8000 openitcockpit/mkdocs /usr/bin/mkdocs build
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/docs -w /docs/en -p 8000:8000 openitcockpit/mkdocs /usr/bin/mkdocs build

mkdir htdocs
cp -r de/site/. htdocs/

mkdir htdocs/en
cp -r en/site/. htdocs/en
```

4. Deploy

Copy the content of the `htdocs` folder to your web servers document root.

To documentation does **not require** any server side programing languages like php, python or java. 

You can also use an Apache2 web server running inside of a Docker container like in this example:
```
docker run --rm -it --name my-apache-app -p 8080:80 -v "$PWD/htdocs":/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:2.4
```
